# House-Prices
I tried out the House Prices: Advanced Regression Techniques challenge from kaggle.com as my first machine learning project. I implemented multiple variable linear regression with python from scratch to estimate a house's price given some of the house's attributes. With my model, I recieved a score of 0.23122.
